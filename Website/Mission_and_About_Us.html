    <p>Our mission is to create an application to make it convenient for users to convert image files to word documents. This helps them save time to get the word files they need, rather than having to type it one by one. Many scan files onto a cloud storage or laptop/computer only to know that it will not be possible for them to edit the text in the image unless it is converted into a word document. We aim to solve that problem with OCR Conversion.</p>

    <p>We are a group of college students working on a project. We chose this idea because it can solve the problem of being able to copy the text from an image. </p>
