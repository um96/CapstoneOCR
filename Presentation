As we all know, we have a PRESENTATION due on the 2nd November. 

Next class we should all come together and check out the visibility of our project and ask

ourselves if what we have is presentable.

I don't mean from a technical position, we can already do that using a few jpgs. We will of course

come prepared with a few working examples - the point is to see if it looks nice enough to be put

on a projector.

The main idea is to compile all of our working stuff together so we have one .exe between us all.

We'll talk about it on Thursday, but for the next week we should put presentability as our main 

focus, and come back to writing code after we present.


I don't mind being the lead presentator on the project, but of course everybody should be able to

talk about their 'specialty'. We could practice presenting if we'd like, but I don't think we will

need to.

The way I have it imagined is the following:


1) I'd start with general project stuff: what it is/ what it does/ very basically how it works

2) Showing the project working using a jpg imput, how to use it

3) Chris can explain the most basic way of it working step by step

4) Anne would talk about the website, what it's for, how to use it

5) Ryan would talk about the database, what its for, why we made it, how does it fit with the project

6) Conclusion



Again this is just my opinion on how we'd tackle it. Please edit and talk about any ideas or preferences you have.

Feel 100% free to express any opinions.

All the best

Uros.
