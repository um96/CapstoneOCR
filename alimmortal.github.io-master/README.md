  <h1>Welcome to my Github page!</h1>
  <p>I have experience in Java and C++ but I have been focusing on Web Development.</p>
  <p>Listed below are projects I have worked on:</p>

- OCR Conversion: <a href="https://alimmortal.github.io/Home.html">alimmortal.github.io/Home.html</a>
<br>
<strong>Project: OCR Conversion</strong>
Project Portion: Website
Contributors: Anne Liang

Main Webpages of Website:
- Home.html
- Convert.html
- Result.html
- Login.html

Host: GitHub Pages
Main Code: Tesseract.js (http://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/)

Uses in Project:
- Home.html: Simple HTML/CSS
- Convert.html: Tesseract.js
- Result.html: Simple Javascript, Google Drive REST API (With Credentials)
- Login.html: Google Login (Credentials)

How to Access Wesite:
1. On any browser, enter "alimmortal.github.io/Home.html". This leads you to home page
   website.
2. Press "Get Started" or the "Convert" (located on top left corner)
3. Select photo
   a. In final presentation, I had multiple languages for the conversion. 
      However, I decided to get rid of them and only stick with English to not go 
      too far in converting other languages.
4. Text will be displayed on the same page you converted.
5. Select "Upload" button to get the text available by Download, Send to Email, or Save to Drive
6. Login is optional, will work with Google Login. The same goes for Drive.

Problems Encountered / Things I Did Not Complete / Hope to Complete in Future:
1. Because it was difficult to get the text into a text document and the time limit, the Result.html
   is not effective and these functions don't really do what they should be doing (pre-made result). It was done with the onetwothree.png as a demo of how it should work.
2. I did not make a Sign Out button for the Google Login.
