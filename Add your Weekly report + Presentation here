Presentation outline:
Slide # - Content

1 - Title
2 - What does this project do? Why use it? (OCR, use it for better organization, editing, etc)
3 - What can the user do? ( There are currently no user options apart from input/submit and saving results)
4 - What is the software built on (Software runs using tessaract and liptonica libraries)
5 - What is tessaract? ( . . . )

I ( Uros) would tackle 1-5, with Chris' help for 6.
Please add what you would like to talk about, and when. The text in ()'s  is justa small summary of what one would say, while
the content is roughly what the slide would say/ be about. Remember that the bulk of the presentation should be given orally, 
with the slides just being bullet points.
