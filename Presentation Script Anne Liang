You'll will need to upload an image file of your choice and will also be able to see an image

application we had already created, onto the website. There are definitely ways to get it working 
on the website including: putting the C++ code onto Node.js, Java, or just coding the application 
using Tesseract in Javascript. However, the problem with this was that the process of getting the 
C++ onto a Node.js or Java file was complicated, and using Tesseract in Javascript to convert a file 
was time consuming, taking much more time to convert an image than converting it using C++.
