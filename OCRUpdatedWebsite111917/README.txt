Things I have done so far with the website:
1. Used HTML and CSS to have a better looking website design.
2. Link pages with each other.
3. Allow users to upload photos
  a. Users can preview photo before uploading it.
  
Problems I have faced when working on it:
1. Difficult to apply a C++ program onto the website.
2. Attempted to use Javascript and/or Node.js to use Tesseract for this project
  a. Did not know how to use Tesseract js properly
  b. Unfamiliar with Node.js
  
Suggestions:
1. PHP (recommended by professor):
  running the C++ executable, if you are able to run it from the command 
  line, then you should be able to run from PhP: https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.shell-exec.php
