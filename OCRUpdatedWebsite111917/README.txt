Things I have done so far with the website:
1. Used HTML and CSS to have a better looking website design.
2. Link pages with each other.
3. Allow users to upload photos
  a. Users can preview photo before uploading it.
  
Problems I have faced when working on it:
1. Difficult to apply a C++ program onto the website.
2. Attempted to use Javascript and/or Node.js to use Tesseract for this project
  a. Did not know how to use Tesseract js properly
      Website: https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js
  b. Unfamiliar with Node.js
  
*UPDATE* The updated website in in the alimmortal.github.io-master folder
