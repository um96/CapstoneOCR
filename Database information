Insert new User into table titled User which stores the login information:

insert into User (LoginName, PasswordHash, FirstName, LastName) values ('users name', SHA2('password', 224), 'First name', 'Last name');

Create row for user to store there images(done at the same time login information is stored):
insert into Users (User) values ('LoginName');

In order to update an image stored in the table titled Users:

update Users set  image1 = ( case when ( image1 is null and User = 'keith' and count = 1) then 'hello' else image1 end), 
image2 = ( case when ( image1 is not null and image2 is null and User = 'keith' and count = 2) then 'hello' else image2 end), 
image3 = ( case when ( image2 is not null and image3 is null and User = 'keith' and count = 3) then 'hello' else image3 end), 
image4 = ( case when ( image3 is not null and image4 is null and User = 'keith' and count = 4) then 'hello' else image4 end), 
image5 = ( case when ( image4 is not null and image5 is null and User = 'keith' and count = 5) then 'hello' else image5 end), 
image6 = ( case when ( image5 is not null and image6 is null and User = 'keith' and count = 6) then 'hello' else image6 end), 
image7 = ( case when ( image6 is not null and image7 is null and User = 'keith' and count = 7) then 'hello' else image7 end), 
image8 = ( case when ( image7 is not null and image8 is null and User = 'keith' and count = 8) then 'hello' else image8 end), 
image9 = ( case when ( image8 is not null and image9 is null and User = 'keith' and count = 9) then 'hello' else image9 end), 
image10 = ( case when ( image9 is not null and image10 is null and User = 'keith' and count = 10) then 'hello' else image10 end);

Retrieve file path
Select (desired image number) from Users where User = LoginName;

Delete stored image path if they do not wish to save the file
update Users set image1 = NULL where User = 'LoginName';

Delete User from storage:
delete from User where LoginName = 'user's login name';
delete from Users where LoginName =  'user's login name';
