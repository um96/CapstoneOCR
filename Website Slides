This is the link to the Google Slides of my part of the presentation. Email or message me if there should be any things I should fix. 
Notes:
  Instead of screenshots, should I instead have a video of the process of getting the file?
  Should I go into the HTML, CSS, and Javascript description (where I used it, etc)?
