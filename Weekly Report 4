For Week 4:
[ ] Create a mockup for a website for the OCR Conversion (I am using Balsamic Mockups)
  [ ] Allow Login? - Gmail, Facebook - To keep record of files converted (Mockup of Login Page *may be optional*)
  [x] General Homepage
[x] Upload instructions for GitHub Bash

Planned for Week 5:
[ ] Research for certain functions to be on the Website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):
  [ ] File Upload - restrict so only certain formats are accepted
  [ ] Send email with file (some websites that convert PDF files, etc, allow users to have the file sent to email)
  [ ] PDF -> Word?
  [ ] Image (.png, .jpeg) -> Word (This is our main part of the project)
