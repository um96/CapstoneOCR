Final Presentations are in ONE MONTH (the 13th of dec. onwards)

They solely focus on the technical aspect of the project, with only 4mins or so from 20 being about the project itself.

The rest is about what we've learned and overcome.

We will have to use powerpoint slides, and there should be around 15 total ( 4ish per person)

The breakdown I'm thinking of is as follows.

The first half will be me and Christopher presenting together about the OCR component  ( we would get together and prepare slides, which we should all post here on github by the way!)

Ryan would be the next to present, and lastly followed by Anne.

Currently, these three sections (Uros + Chris part, Ryan part, Anne's part) are fully independent, but it is entirely up to the individual presenting if they'd like to work together with another group member...

At some point, around the 6th or 7th ( we'll figure it out when we're closer), we should have the powerpoint fully completed, and we'd practice together. The point of this practice is to establish when the next person can begin talking, so it is seamless with no breaks during the actual presentations - you can totally read off a script if you'd like. 

This is all very rough since we're a month off the presentations, but this is the general idea, and its not at all set in stone. If you have any idea, mention it or add it to here. Remember, only one month left and we're done!
