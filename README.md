Remember to give me your weekly report! You can put it anywhere on github, or email me at Uros.Milanovic63 @ hunter, or anywhere else,  just as long as you do it! I'll give out the reports to the prof. at around 11pm Sundays just so theres no issues with time for anyone.
Also be sure to post your code at least once a week-ish if you're using already posted code. If you're making your own new file, do it whenever you feel its good to go - but be sure no two people are doing the same thing as to not waste time. ATM im still working on UI, trying to get it sop that the user may browse their documents and select a file to give to the software. Anne is also working on some website stuff. . .

For Week 4:
[ ] Create a mockup for a website for the OCR Conversion (I am using Balsamic Mockups)
  [ ] Allow Login? - Gmail, Facebook - To keep record of files converted (Mockup of Login Page *may be optional*)
  [x] General Homepage
[x] Upload instructions for GitHub Bash

Planned for Week 5:
[ ] Research for certain functions to be on the Website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):
  [ ] File Upload - restrict so only certain formats are accepted
  [ ] Send email with file (some websites that convert PDF files, etc, allow users to have the file sent to email)
  [ ] PDF -> Word?
  [ ] Image (.png, .jpeg) -> Word (This is our main part of the project)
