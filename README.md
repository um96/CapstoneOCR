Since Christopher fully completed basic jpg/png to text conversion, our current leftover tasks are the following:

(FEEL 100% FREE TO EDIT THIS IN ANY WAY if you feel something needs more attention or if I've left something out.)
(I'm also writing this from my perspective - I didn't do any work on the database/website aspects so I'm only speaking from the info that I know . . .)

-Finish anything left with the website, and implement Christopher's code.
-Any database things left to do
-Get everyone's input on the program UI- things like text, background, design, etc. - If you have an idea, we can use it
-Convert PDF to text files

OPTIONAL:
-Convert more complex jpgs, with smaller text and "broken" text ( text with a line though it, for ex.), ignoring garbage, etc...
- Anything else?

Thanks everyone,
Uros
