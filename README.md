Please please please remember to post your reports by midnight. I can't/won't check my emails on Monday mornings to convert it all to pdf and send it, since I get up early enough as it is.  If you can't remember, please set an alarm or mark your schedules or something. . .

Also: Now that we're getting in the thick of things, if your file includes .h files or libraries, remember to make a folder of those to post on here as well. Of course this isn't anything we have to worry about this month, but keep it in mind that fi you would like others to run/edit your code, all files should be included . . .



 Happy Columbus Day
