Remember to give me your weekly report! You can put it anywhere on github, or email me at Uros.Milanovic63 @ hunter, or anywhere else,  just as long as you do it! I'll give out the reports to the prof. at around 11pm Sundays just so theres no issues with time for anyone.
Also be sure to post your code at least once a week-ish if you're using already posted code. If you're making your own new file, do it whenever you feel its good to go - but be sure no two people are doing the same thing as to not waste time. ATM im still working on UI, trying to get it sop that the user may browse their documents and select a file to give to the software. Anne is also working on some website stuff. . .
